			<li> My name is Erin Yonak and I am a Communication Design major with an English minor. I am a junior
			</li>
			<br><li> I have lots of background as a traditional artist, but the past few years I have gone more and more in-depth with adobe products and online stuff. At first I didn't think I would like web design, but after my internship this summer I figured out that I actually love it. I am very excited to be here!
			</br></li>
			<br><li> I have very minimal experience with html. I learned how to scan some of it this summer to find things like color and font size, but I have never built a site with it before.
			</br></li>
			<br><li> I hope to learn the basics of how to build a good website. Really I'm happy to learn anything so I can make myself more marketable.
			</br></li>
			<br><li> Designing for a screen seems to be much more variable than for paper. On paper, once you have a layout, that's it, really. But for a website, you have to account for applications like outlook (I helped build email newsletters) and for mobile devices and tablets and different browser sizes. There are quite a few more moving parts in web design, so it's a bit more like a puzzle than paper design.

			<br><li> <a href="https://libris.photoshelter.com/">Libris</a> I love this website because the visual language is compelling and modern. I love the way the items come together as you scroll down the page, and the colors and gradients work very well together. 
			</br></li>
			<br><li> <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> This page does a good job of making the website accessible, and as you scroll down the page the information changes while the action points do not, so that the person interacting with the website is never far away from the call to action. I'm guessing that would help with a click rate, if the button is right next to the compelling information.
			</br></li>
			<br><li> <a href="https://www.hellomonday.com/home">Hello Monday!</a> I like this website because it took very few clicks to find out what the company was about, and the layout is unique. The home page cycles through stories and the color schemes change with it, which I think is a very successful use of color. It also shows that the bare bones of the website had to convertible to many different themes.
