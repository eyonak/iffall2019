		<span class="verse1">
			<p>Hold on, hold on</p>
			<p>Let me get the words out before I burst</p>
			<p>There's no truth at all</p>
			<p>Poking at the giant eyes of ancient Gods</p>
		</span><br><br>
		<span class="verse1">
			<p>Cool heads have failed</p>
			<p>Now it's time for me to have my turn</p>
			<p>Kiss me, kiss me</p>
			<p>Life is way too short to scream and shout</p>
		</span><br>
		<span class="bridge">
			<p>Flashed up in my wildest dreams the dark red blood streams</p>
			<p>Stretching out like vast cracked ice</p>
			<p>The veins of you, the veins of me like great forest trees</p>
			<p>Pushing through and on and in</p>
		</span><br><br>
		<span class="chorus">
			<p>Gliding like a satellite in the broken night</p>
			<p>And when I wake you're there, I'm saved</p>
			<p>Your love is life piled tight and high, set against the sky</p>
			<p>That seems to balance on it's own</p>
		</span><br><br>
		<span class="verse1">
			<p>Sing out, sing out</p>
			<p>The silence only eats us from the inside up</p>
			<p>I meant no harm</p>
			<p>But I only get to say these words too late</p>
		</span><br><br>
		<span class="verse1">
			<p>Wake up, wake up</p>
			<p>Dreaming only leads to more and more nightmares</p>
			<p>Snap out of it</p>
			<p>You said it in a way that showed you really cared</p>
		</span><br><br>
		<span class="bridge">
			<p>Flashed up in my wildest dreams the dark red blood streams</p>
			<p>Stretching out like vast cracked ice</p>
			<p>The veins of you, the veins of me like great forest trees</p>
			<p>Pushing through and on and in</p>
		</span><br><br>
		<span class="chorus">
			<p>Gliding like a satellite in the broken night</p>
			<p>And when I wake you're there, I'm saved</p>
			<p>Your love is life piled tight and high set against the sky</p>
			<p>That seems to balance on it's own</p>
		</span><br><br>
		<span class="verse1">
			<p>Send your lifeboats out for me</p>
			<p>Send your lifeboat out</p>
			<p>Send your lifeboats out for me</p>
			<p>Send your lifeboat out</p>
		</span><br><br>
		<span class="verse1">
			<p>Send your lifeboats out for me</p>
			<p>Send your lifeboat out</p>
			<p>Send your lifeboats out for me</p>
			<p>Send your lifeboat out</p>
