		<h2>Legacy</h2>
		<p>
			Walt Disney, on being presented with the Legion of Honour in 1936, expressed gratitude to Méliès and his fellow pioneer Émile Cohl, saying they “discovered the means of placing poetry within the reach of the man in the street.”

			The Smashing Pumpkins released a music video for their 1995 single, “Tonight, Tonight”, highly inspired by Georges Méliès’s film A Trip to the Moon. The music video was directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris.

			Terry Gilliam has called Méliès “the first great film magician,” adding: “His joyous sense of fun and ability to astound were a big influence on both my early animations and then my live-action films… Of course, Méliès still has a tight creative grip on me.”

			The 2007 novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick, and the 2011 film Hugo by Martin Scorsese, centre on the later life of Méliès, who is played by Sir Ben Kingsley in the film Hugo. Madeleine Malthête-Méliès, Méliès’ granddaughter, is played by the young Chloë Grace Moretz. The film includes reconstructions of some of the fantastical stage sets which appeared in Melies’s early films.
