			<span style="color:white">Feedback received: </span> Love the color scheme, very cute. Put more images inbetween all the information, people love images. Design-wise the panels are very strong for delineating the information. Put an image of some of the ingredients after the ingredients panel.
		</p>
			<span style="color:white">Feedback given: </span> I thought something was wrong with the image because when scrolling down, the first thing I see is a blurriness. I like the footer. The tofu frying image has worse quality than the others. I like the header for the page because it gives an idea of the aesthetic from the start. Some of the headers for sections need a little more delineation.
